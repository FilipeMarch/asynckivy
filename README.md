# AsyncKivy

(This module was originally created as [GitHub Gist code](https://gist.github.com/gottadiveintopython/5f4a775849f9277081c396de65dc57c1), and moved to here.)

### Note

[The PR for async support](https://github.com/kivy/kivy/pull/6368) was already merged to master branch, and it would be available on version `2.0.0`. So there is no point of using this module unless you are using Kivy version `1.x.x`.

### Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/gottadiveintopython/asynckivy#egg=asynckivy
```
